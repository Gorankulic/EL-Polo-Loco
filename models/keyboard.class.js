// Define a class named Keyboard.
class Keyboard {
    // Define properties for different keyboard keys, initialized to false.
    LEFT = false; // Represents the left arrow key.
    RIGHT = false; // Represents the right arrow key.
    TOP = false; // Represents the up arrow key.
    DOWN = false; // Represents the down arrow key.
    JUMP = false; // Represents a custom key for jumping.
    D = false; // Represents a custom key 'D'.

    // Each property represents the state of the corresponding key: 
    // true if the key is currently pressed, and false if it's not.

    // You can use an instance of this class to track the state of these keys
    // and make decisions in your game based on which keys are pressed or released.
